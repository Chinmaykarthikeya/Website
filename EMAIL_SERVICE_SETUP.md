# Email Service Setup - Final Solution

## Current Status
Your contact form now uses Formspree, which has better domain support than Web3Forms.

### Formspree Setup Required
1. Go to [formspree.io](https://formspree.io)
2. Sign up with your email: **karthikeyachinmay@gmail.com**
3. Create a new form in your dashboard
4. Get your form ID and replace `xwkyvgev` in the code with your actual form ID
5. Make a test submission from your live website to activate the form

### Current Configuration ✅ ACTIVE
- **Service**: Formspree (50 free submissions per month)
- **Endpoint**: `https://formspree.io/f/mkgzvzgv` (YOUR ACTIVE FORM)
- **Email Delivery**: Direct to karthikeyachinmay@gmail.com
- **Backup**: Local storage for all messages
- **Status**: Ready to send emails!

### Benefits of Formspree
- ✅ Better domain support (works with Replit and Vercel)
- ✅ 50 free submissions per month
- ✅ Automatic spam protection
- ✅ No complex setup required
- ✅ Works immediately after account verification

### Test Email Process
1. Deploy your portfolio to Vercel (better domain support)
2. Create Formspree account with karthikeyachinmay@gmail.com
3. Update form ID in your code
4. Test submission from live site
5. Check Gmail inbox for confirmation

## Alternative: Direct Backend Email (If Needed)
If form services continue to have issues, I can implement a backend email solution using:
- Nodemailer with Gmail SMTP
- SendGrid API
- Mailgun API

But Formspree should work well once deployed to Vercel.
